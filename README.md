Pattern Logic Tool
Project Description

Pattern Logic Tool is a C programming project that generates different numeric patterns using nested loops.
The program is menu-driven and prints patterns based on user input without using arrays or extra storage.

Aim

To design and implement a C program that prints numeric patterns using nested loops based on user choice.

Program Logic

Display a menu of patterns.

Take user choice as input.

Take number of rows as input.

Use an outer loop to control rows.

Use an inner loop to control columns.

Print numbers using loop counters.

Move to the next line after each row.

Repeat until the selected pattern is completed.
